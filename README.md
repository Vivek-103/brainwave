# 🧠 Brainwave - Advanced React & Tailwind Web App

Brainwave is a modern, responsive web application built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to explore advanced front-end development concepts such as reusable components, utility-first styling, and scalable UI architecture.

This project was built as a part of my journey to master front-end development and gain hands-on experience with industry-level practices. The design and structure are inspired by the excellent work and tutorials of **JavaScript Mastery**.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚛️ Reusable and modular React components

- Deepen my understanding of **React.js** at an advanced level
- Practice clean component design patterns and responsive UI techniques
- Learn how to structure real-world web applications effectively
- Improve my confidence in building interactive front-end experiences

## 🔧 Tech Stack
